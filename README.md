### What I learned

Re-doing this challenge as a Tailwindcss project. Learned a lot about tailwindcss and adding custom css to the tailwind.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1040px) {
  .speech-bubble {
    top: -40px;
    left: calc(100% - 100px);
  }
  .triangle {
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -20px;
    right: 0;
    border-left: 25px solid transparent;
    border-top: 25px solid white;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to increasing my tailwindcss skills.
